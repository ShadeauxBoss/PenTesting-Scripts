# **PenTesting-Scripts**
A list of scripts in various languages with varrying purposes to assist in pen-testing.

## **1. SUBHUNTER.SH**
This is a Bash script written to automate AssetFinder, Amass, SubJack, and NMAP abilities, and will send the results to a folder named after to the domain used in the scan. I will write the intel to a variety of .txt files. 

**_---UPDATE--- 11/12/2020_**

**SUBHUNTER - adittional features added**: Amass, SubJack, Httprobe, and NMAP. Each tool is called to perform its function and creates a folder and file of the intel collected. This script enumerates, and organizes intel systematically to provide the pen-tester with a list of active subdomain, open ports, and potential domain take-overs. This allows the tester to multitask and "set it and forget it" while the scan happens.
