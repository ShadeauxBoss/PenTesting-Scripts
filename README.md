<<1. SUBHUNTER.SH>>
This is a Bash script written to automate AssetFinder, Amass, SubJack, and NMAP abilities, and send the results to a .txt file. 

---UPDATE--- 11/12/2020

SUBHUNTER - adittional features added: Amass, SubJack, Httprobe, and NMAP. Each tool is called to perform its function and creates a folder and file of the intel collected. This script enumerates, and organizes intel systematically to provide the pen-tester with a list of active subdomain, open ports, and potential domain take-overs. This allows he tester to multitask and "set it and forget it" while the scan happen.
